    <section class="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Goodreads is a website that lets you effortlessly search for, write, and read book reviews without having to go to a bookshop. You can find new books or novels that interest you, as well as receive recommendations for comparable genres popular among the community. You can also see what books your friends are reading or reviewing, as well as keep track of any novels or books you want to read. For this project, I conducted user research using interviews and focus groups to create personas and user path maps. I analysed information architecture using card sorting, created low-fidelity to high-fidelity prototypes for the community page, and conducted user testing and heuristic evaluation to discover and address usability concerns.</p>
