      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>We were inspired by many puzzle games that we have seen and played. We decided to create this game to promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills. We chose to use a 2D pixel design for this game. Our team developed a puzzle game using C# and Unity for game development. For the game scenes, we used Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop for graphic design.</p>
